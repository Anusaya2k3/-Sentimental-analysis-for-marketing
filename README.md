SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS FOR MARKETING

Data source: 
•	Data for sentiment analysis can be collected from various sources, including social media platforms, customer reviews on websites, surveys, and more. These sources provide valuable text data for analysis

How to run the code and any dependency:
   AI_Sentimental analysis for marketing 

How to Run :
•	Install jupyter notebook in your create project.
•	pip install jupyter lab
•	pip install jupiter noteboook (or)
              1. Download Anaconda Community software for desktop.
              2. Install the Anaconda Community.
              3. Open jupiter noteboook.
              4. Type the code and executive the given code.

 Overview :
•	Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that analyzes and determines the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in text data, such as customer reviews, social media comments, or survey responses.

 Requirements :
•	Python 3.x
•	Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)
•	Jupyter Notebook (for running the Jupyter notebooks)

Dataset :
This is a list of over 34,000 consumer reviews for Amazon products like the Kindle, Fire TV Stick, and more provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. The dataset includes basic product information, rating, review text, and more for each product.

 Installation :
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjsuryanehru/company-registration-roc.git
   cd company-registration-roc
   
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

Data Preprocessing :
•	Data Collection: Gather text data from relevant sources.
•	Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data by removing noise, such as special characters and stop words
2. Execute the Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing:
   bash
   jupyter notebook data_preprocessing.ipynb

Data source:
Data source available in repository (Download and use it)

Model Training :
1. Train and evaluate machine learning models using the preprocessed data. You can find the code in [model_training.ipynb](model_training.ipynb).
2. Execute the Jupyter notebook for model training :
   bash
   jupyter notebook model_training.ipynb
 Sentimental  Analysis:
1. Perform Sentimental analysis on the trained models to evaluate their performance. Instructions can be found in [sentimental_analysis.ipynb](sentimental_analysis.ipynb).
2. Execute the Jupyter notebook for Sentimental analysis:
   bash
   jupyter notebook roc_analysis.ipynb
   

Results :
The project will generate Sentimental curves and provide evaluation metrics for the machine learning models. The results will be saved in the `results` directory.

Sentimental analysis for marketing  

 Overview :
In marketing, sentiment analysis helps companies understand how customers feel about their products, services, and brand. It can be used to gauge public perception, identify customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and gain insights into market trends.

 Data Source :
Data for sentiment analysis can be collected from various sources, including social media platforms, customer reviews on websites, surveys, and more. These sources provide valuable text data for analysis.

Tools and Technologies: 
Sentiment analysis can be performed using various NLP libraries and tools like NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

 Dependencies :
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
•	Python 3.x
•	Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for interactive exploration)
•	Required Python libraries (install using `pip` or `conda`):
•	Pandas
•	Scikit-learn
•	Matplotlib (for data visualization
Bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

 Installation :
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
`lbash
git clone https://github.com/jjsuryanehru/company-registration-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd company-registration-prediction
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

Data Preparation :
1. Place your company registration dataset in the project directory, named `Amaxon.csv`.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script (e.g., sentimental analysis for marketing.ipynb`) for data preprocessing, analysis, and prediction.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook/script to load and preprocess the data.

Model Training and Evaluation :
1. Train the AI model using your preprocessed data.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using sentimental analysis. The sentimental analysis will be generated as part of this step.

 Running the Code :
•	Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
bash
jupyter notebook sentimental analysis for marketing.ipynb
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to run the code, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate it.

Python Script :
1. Run the Python script using the following command
bash
python sentimental analysis for marketing.py
2. The script will execute the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Output :
The project will generate the following output:

•	Sentimental analysis for model evaluation.
•	Customer reviews model performance.
•	Any relevant visualizations or insights depending on the exploration

 Conclusion :
This README provides an overview of the project, its data source, dependencies, and instructions for running the code. The Jupyter Notebook or Python script will guide you through the process of exploring and predicting company registration trends using an AI-driven approach.
